# Freelancers-Payment-Management-Platform

![Application Logo](/app_logo.png "App Logo")

This application allows companies to publish tasks and manage the process of assigning those tasks to freelancers.

The application, developed in JAVA, enables the users to make and manage payments to freelancers and enables administrators to monitor both the payments made by the organizations and freelancersâ€™ performance. To increase the maintainability of the software analysis, Object-Oriented (OO) software design was adopted, and the implementation followed a test-driven development (TDD) approach. An User Interface was built with JavaFX.

All the documentation is available in 'docs' folder, wich include Use Cases Diagram, Domain Model and System Sequence Diagram.

You can find all the credentials for login in POTAplication.java class.
